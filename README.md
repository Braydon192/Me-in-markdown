# Me-in-markdown
     My name is Braydon Stalo and I am in 12th grade at Chatsworth charter highschool. My favorite movie is Ready Player One because it is about video games and I like video games. Some ne knowledge that I have learned is how to cook some rice cake. A personal achievement that I have made is hitting top 5000 in ranked Call Of Duty Mobile. One fun fact about me is that I have a part time job as a baseball umpire. My goals for this year is to pass every class with a B or higher with an extra goal of having nothing less than an A in my AP classes.
     Over the summer, I went to both Hawaii and Las Vegas. I went to hawaii for one week right before school started with me getting back on monday. I went to Las Vegas twice for 5 days each time to visit my grandma in the hospital. My favorite food is burgers, and the place where I have had my favorite burgers is Red Robin so far, I have not had a better burger anywhere else so far. In this class I hope to learn all the coding I would need for an engineering job, but I do not know what kind of enginer I want to be yet. My most memorable exirence over the summer was in Hawaii at the Polynation Cultural Center where I got to try my first coconut while watching a show. The most recent tech project I have worked on is the AP COMP SCI PRIN final where me and my group made a random famouse people generator.
     I have not participated in any sports recently, but I used to play baseball at NCLL as a first baseman, third baseman, and pitcher. I have not engaged in any creative activities, but I took art class freshman year. Over the break I did not volenteer, but every year I work on the floats in the rose parade. We do not have any family traditions that I know of but I got to see a whole bunch of traditions in Hawaii. Over the summer I helped my friend and his mom move some cabinets, then we went to Red Robins where I watched my friend crush a whole large pizza and a cesar salad. My future goals are to go to a two year college then go into a four then what ever I want to pursue then hopefully become an engineer.
